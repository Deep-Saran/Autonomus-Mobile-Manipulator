## Description:
ORB SLAM2 which uses depth sensors to analyze the environment around the robot. Based on the octomap and final coordinates input to D-star algorithm. The path to travel from intial point to final point is generated using D-star algorithm in MATLAB and published to ROS. The pseudo pick and place is performed at the final point, using ALB5 arm robot using inverse kinematics.
